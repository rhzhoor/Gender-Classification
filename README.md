# Gender classification
This repository contains two projects that focus on gender classification using two different machine learning techniques: SVMlib and logistic regression. The projects are designed to demonstrate how to use these models to predict the gender of individuals based on a set of features.

The SVMlib project uses support vector machines to classify gender based on features such as height, weight, and age. The logistic regression project, on the other hand, uses logistic regression to classify gender based on similar features.

Both projects provide a clear and concise example of how to implement machine learning techniques to solve classification problems. The code is well-documented, and the projects are accompanied by detailed explanations of the methodology and results.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in machine learning and gender classification.
